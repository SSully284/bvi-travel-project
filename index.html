          <h2>Why the British Virgin Islands?</h2>
          <h3>Explore warm sands and beautiful reefs</h3>
          <p>
            This British Overseas Territory consists of 4 larger islands: Tortola, Anegada, Virgin Gorda, and Jost Van
            Dyke.
            There
            are also 32 smaller islands and islets that make up the British Virgin islands, of which more than 20 are
            uninhabited. There are 63 popular dive sites in the BVI, which include 57 coral reef sites
            and 6
            artificial reefs that have been created by shipwrecks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sailing is one of the favorite sports in the British Virgin Islands. The activity is a popular attraction
            for
            tourists who have fun in anything from
            small boats to fully decked-out and crewed luxury yachts can be rented or chartered. Other water-based
            activities include island-hopping, poker-run, snorkeling, windsurfing, scuba diving, fishing, and more. With
            clean pristine beaches and some of the finest sand (Loblolly beach, Anegada) you are sure to make memories
            you won't forget.
